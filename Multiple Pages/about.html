      <h3> Our Story </h3>
        <p>
          Since my journey started, I’ve done thorough research from a professional to a woodworking amateur with a growing practice. I’m happy to announce that my study could work as a rudder for your woodworking journey. <br> <br>

          When I was a school-going young boy, I was first acquainted with the word woodworking. Once I was with my uncle in a small production house full of many woodworking tools.
          
          My uncle warned me about the dangerous woodworking tools, for example, chain saws, hammers, sanders, and jointers. I was hooked in that house, surrounded by different heavy-duty tools.
          
          Unfortunately, I lost my passion and enthusiasm when the program was closed by the school. However, I had decided that I would complete the program and learn the full details. <br> <br>
          Fortunately, I had gotten the chance to disclose my creativity, which was pretty exciting and demanding. Yes, in the realm of woodworking, I had discovered myself in my own problem-solution matter. It was a surprising start of necessity. 
          
          Years ago, during my first marriage anniversary, my family suffered a severe water problem. Not getting any way intermittently, I started to solve the issue by myself. Firstly, I had to make a remodel plan and rip out some old wood boards. I was almost near to heart failure when I received the quote from the woodworking project director. Fortunately, I had discovered one of my fellows who had little idea about woodworking. Finally, we started fixing the problem by ourselves.
